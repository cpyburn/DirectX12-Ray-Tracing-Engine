How to create a ray tracing engine from scratch in DirectX12

The purpose of this repo is to go through all the steps of creating a ray tracing engine from scratch using directx 12 and visual studio.

I am also looking for a few people to join my team to create a ray tracing RTS similar to warcraft3 with heros, set up a kick starter, and a discord server. If you have any interest please send your resume and interests to cpyburn78@gmail.com.  There will be no money involved until the game is released on Steam, or the kick starter makes enough money to pay for your services.

I am also working on a single player, possibly MMO, RPG.  I have put this on hold for this project, but if you have interest in creating a single player RPG like skyrim, or MMORPG like Everquest/World of Warcraft follow me or these repos to find out more in the future.

This project will be a work in progress, meaning that code could change at anytime. I may backtrack and fix something, or do something better, etc.

OK. Lets get started!

Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2022 or higher
- Raytracing capable card
- x64 project
