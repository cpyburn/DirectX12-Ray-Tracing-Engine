This tutorial is going to add fullscreen capability to the library. For the most part, we are backwards engineering / copy pasteing this [Microsoft DirectX 12 sample project](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/tree/master/Samples/Desktop/D3D12Fullscreen) and adding it to ours. You may ask why? It is a good way for us to test fullscreen throughout the building of the engine and I personally think all games should handle resizing of the screen correctly.

First we want to create a class for holding most of the graphics code, like root signatures, pipelines, samplers etc.

Create a class called GraphicsContexts
