# DirectX12 Ray Tracing Engine
We are going to create a Ray Tracing engine from scratch in DirectX12 using Visual Studio Pro.

Please post all issues in GitHub issues for the repo. If something isn't clear or is confusing, you can also post that in the issues and I will do my best to make it clear.

I am also looking for a few people to join my team to create a ray tracing RTS similar to warcraft3 with heros, set up a kick starter, and a discord server. 

Knowledge you should possess or wanting to learn:
- c++
- rasterization
- matrices and vectors
- directx 12, or vulkan

Things you will learn:
- ray tracing in c++
- A star pathfinding
- all graphic engine concepts: 2d, 3d, audio, heightmaps, collision, billboards, etc.

Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2022 or higher
- Raytracing capable card or willing to impliment RTX [fallback](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/tree/master/Libraries/D3D12RaytracingFallback) 
- x64 project

A good book to read:
[3D Game Programming with DirectX 12](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-3D-Game-Programming-DirectX/dp/1942270062/ref=sr_1_1?crid=L5KHVXIH2G9O&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Skg7Qn77SnWByJTez6Z5q1IUJeMVfWZ7JopNz06FEhJwgvj7_Q8cUk1D2CHY7fG-pqc3i3z6Ne481D7pRMehLgPNf7TsvM8tLvrO2gtspFQ-DtczrMtf_rQkf-dC-dNoDAg49u3Frskkr_Ro-ZWrzoleaaBuAK-DKXXR6HhI_hawSCuBh_1bUtb3X5WK56n4FtSJ9ZY7topVIfrj407yDkNvd28aXqZWAYnWIz423QE.QQfxwaL_oAgcTV377fbwiT--YGlDXLUCki-qlk8pjVo&dib_tag=se&keywords=directx+12+book&qid=1760812558&sprefix=directx+12+boo%2Caps%2C169&sr=8-1)
